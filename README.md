CS-150 Project - Coffee Shop Event Driven Simulation

Running a business is particularly difficult because one is simultaneously concerned about costs as well as the profits obtained by operating such a business. As a consultant hired by a coffee shop startup, the main goal at hand is to determine the number of cashiers that the shop should hire to ensure that profits are maximized.

The coffee shop is said to open at 6 am and closes at 10 pm, hence customers arriving exactly at the opening/ closing times as well as in between those times are eligible but not guaranteed to be served. Depending on the number of cashiers available, the choice is then made to serve the customers upon arrival or have them wait in line until there is an available cashier. The length of the line cannot exceed eight times the number of cashiers hired by the store; if the former is true the customers arriving will be turned away.
With these constraints in mind, the goal was to develop a simulation that would emulate the functioning of this coffee shop while keeping track of the profits as the number of cashiers that the store hires increases. Ultimately the number of cashiers that yields the highest net profit, would be the number of cashiers the coffee shop hires.
